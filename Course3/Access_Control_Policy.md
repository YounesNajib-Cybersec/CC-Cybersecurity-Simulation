# 🔐 Access Control Concepts – Security Controls Project

This project shows understanding of key security control layers and access models through clear tables and real-world examples.

## 🧩 Security Control

**A control** is a safeguard or countermeasure designed to preserve the **Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability (CIA)** of data.

---

## 📖 Core Concepts

| Concept  | Description  |
|----------|--------------|
| **Subject** | An agent or entity (e.g., user, application) that can access resources |
| **Object**  | The resource being protected (e.g., file, server, system) |
| **Rules**   | Set of permissions or restrictions defining how subjects can interact with objects, based on policy |

## 🧱 Types of Access Controls

Access controls are typically categorized into three main layers:

| Layer                     | Description                                                                 | Real-World Analogy                    |
|---------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------|
| **Physical Controls**     | Tangible protections (e.g., doors, fences, security guards)                 | Locked office door or security guard |
| **Logical/Technical**     | System-based protections (e.g., firewalls, passwords, encryption)           | Login screen or system firewall      |
| **Administrative Controls** | Policies, procedures, and guidelines that define how security is enforced | Security policies or employee training |

---

### 📌 Physical Controls:
- Badge systems & gate entry access  
- Security cameras and surveillance  
- Biometric door locks  
- Environmental design (e.g., lighting, fencing)  

---

### 📌 Logical/Technical Controls:
- Password authentication systems  
- Biometric authentication on devices (e.g., Face ID)  
- Firewalls and intrusion detection/prevention systems  
- Role-based access systems  

---

### 📌 Administrative Controls:
- Security training & awareness programs  
- Background checks during hiring  
- Security policy documentation and enforcement  
- Regular access audits and incident response procedures

## 🧠 Access Control Models

| Model  | Description | Real-Life Example |
|--------|-------------|-------------------|
| **Discretionary Access Control (DAC)** | Owner decides who can access the resource | Private social media account – user decides followers |
| **Mandatory Access Control (MAC)**     | System-enforced, based on classification levels | Government system – access based on clearance |
| **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**   | Access based on a person’s job role or function | Company limits financial data to accountants only |
